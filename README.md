## TASK

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed for preprocessing data, training a model, and evaluating its performance. The solution leverages GitHub Actions for CI/CD and Docker for containerization. It uses AWS Sagemaker as the primary deployment option but can be adapted for other cloud services like Azure/Databricks.

## Project Structure

- `.github/workflows/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow for the CI/CD pipeline.
  - `main.yml`: Configuration file for the CI/CD pipeline.
- `data/`: Directory for storing raw and processed data. Initially empty, it will be populated by the data preprocessing script.
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained models. Initially empty, it will be populated by the model training script.
- `notebooks/`: Directory for storing Jupyter notebooks. Initially empty, it can be used for exploratory data analysis or experiments.
- `scripts/`: Directory for Python scripts.
  - `data_cleaning.py`: Script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - `train_model.py`: Script for model training.
  - `evaluate_model.py`: Script for model evaluation.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `ASSUMPTIONS_AND_CONSIDERATIONS.md`: Document detailing assumptions, business considerations, team interactions, and scope of responsibilities.










**Explanation of the Empty Directories** 

The project directory structure includes several directories that are initially empty. These directories are essential for organizing different components of the project.

1. data/

The data/ directory is used to store raw and processed data files. Initially, this directory is empty. However, after running the data_preprocessing.py script, this directory will contain the processed data files such as processed_X.csv and processed_y.csv. This setup allows for a clear separation of raw and processed data, making data management more straightforward.

2. models/

The models/ directory is intended for storing trained model files. Like the data/ directory, it is initially empty. After executing the train_model.py script, this directory will hold the trained model file, such as xgboost_model.json. This organization ensures that all model artifacts are stored in a designated location, facilitating easier access and management of model versions.

3. notebooks/

The notebooks/ directory is designed for storing Jupyter notebooks. This directory is also empty at the outset. It can be used for exploratory data analysis, experiments, and other ad-hoc analysis performed using Jupyter notebooks. While it remains empty initially, it serves as a dedicated space for any notebooks created and saved during the project's lifecycle
